## Deployment

### Overview

The deployment plan outlines the process for launching the Tiqzy platform—a Whitelabel ticket reselling system. The system allows businesses to manage and resell tickets under their own brand. This document focuses on deploying a microservices architecture in production environments using **OpenShift** for container orchestration. It emphasizes scalability, reliability, and user experience.

### Infrastructure

#### Cloud Provider
- **Provider**: Azure (Microsoft Azure) is recommended for scalability and integration with OpenShift.

#### Microservice architecture
- **Containerization**: Each service will be packaged as a Docker container and deployed on OpenShift. Microservices include ticketing, payment, ordering, stock management, wishlist management, email service, and integration with third-party services (e.g. TiqzyAPI, Stripe).
- **Service discovery**: OpenShift will handle service discovery and internal communication between microservices via its built-in service mesh.

#### Hosting
- **OpenShift platform**: OpenShift will orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across a cluster.
  - **Cluster configuration**: Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) will be used to manage Kubernetes clusters.
- **Application servers**: Each microservice will be deployed as a set of containers distributed across OpenShift nodes, ensuring high availability.
- **Load balancer**: OpenShift’s Ingress Controller will handle traffic routing across the microservices.
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database (or PostgreSQL) for structured data, and Azure Table Storage for unstructured data, with services using their own independent database instances to avoid cross-service dependencies.
- **Caching**: Azure Cache for Redis to cache API responses and reduce server load.
- **CDN**: Azure CDN for delivering static assets (images, styles, etc.).

#### Storage
- **File storage**: Azure Blob Storage for static assets and backups.
- **Database backup**: Automated backups via Azure SQL Database to ensure data safety.

### Application deployment

#### Prerequisites
- **Containerization**: Ensure that each microservice (e.g., ticketing, payments) is containerized using Docker.
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Use OpenShift Pipelines (based on Tekton) or Azure DevOps to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Configuration management**: Use OpenShift ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment variables, API keys, and sensitive data.
  
#### Steps
1. **Provision infrastructure**: 
   - Use Terraform or ARM templates to provision Azure resources, including VMs for OpenShift nodes, Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, and Azure Cache for Redis.
   - Deploy an OpenShift cluster using Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO).
2. **Deploy microservices**:
   - Build and containerize each microservice.
   - Push container images to a private registry (Azure Container Registry or OpenShift internal registry).
   - Use OpenShift’s deployment configurations to deploy each microservice.
   - Configure OpenShift routes and Ingress for traffic routing.
3. **Set up API gateways**: 
   - Deploy an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, NGINX) within OpenShift to manage external requests and routing to the appropriate microservices.
4. **Set up databases**:
   - Each microservice that needs persistence will have its own database.
   - Migrate the database schema for each service to its own instance in Azure SQL Database or PostgreSQL.
5. **Payment integration**: Ensure Stripe API is integrated and tested via a dedicated microservice.
6. **DNS configuration**: Use Azure DNS or OpenShift’s built-in DNS management for domain routing.
7. **SSL certificates**: Install and configure SSL certificates for HTTPS via Azure Key Vault and integrate with OpenShift routes.
8. **Caching**: Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data across microservices.

### Monitoring & maintenance

#### Monitoring tools
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Integrated into OpenShift for monitoring resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and application health.
- **Azure monitor**: For additional insights and alerts, especially for Azure SQL Database and Blob Storage.
- **Logging**: OpenShift’s built-in logging stack will be used to capture and analyze application logs.
- **Sentry**: For error tracking and reporting.

#### Backup strategy
- Automated database backups using Azure SQL Database’s built-in backup services.
- Azure Blob Storage for file backups with lifecycle management policies.
- OpenShift backups using Velero for cluster and resource backups.

### Scalability plan

- **Initial phase**: The system will scale to support up to 5,000 users.
- **Scaling strategy**: 
   - OpenShift Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) will automatically scale microservices based on CPU and memory usage.
   - Scale databases using read replicas.
   - Implement API rate limiting via the API Gateway to handle high traffic.

### Security considerations

- **Authentication**: OpenShift OAuth will be used to integrate OAuth2 for API authentication.
- **Data encryption**: 
  - Ensure all data at rest (Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database) is encrypted using Azure Key Vault.
  - Encrypt communication between microservices using mutual TLS (mTLS) with OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio).
- **Firewall**: Use OpenShift Network Policies and Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic flow and restrict access to critical resources.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI/CD tools**: Use OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) for continuous integration and deployment, or integrate with Azure DevOps for the full pipeline.
- **Testing**: Run automated unit tests and integration tests in OpenShift Pipelines or Azure DevOps before each deployment.
- **Deployment Strategy**: 
   - Implement a blue-green or canary deployment strategy to minimize downtime and risks during production updates.
   - Leverage OpenShift's native rolling deployments for seamless updates.

### Post-deployment

- Perform thorough smoke testing to verify that all microservices are working as expected.
- Use OpenShift’s monitoring tools to observe resource usage and detect potential bottlenecks.
- Gather user feedback and iterate on the platform as needed.
- Conduct regular security audits and performance optimizations.

### Future considerations

- **User growth**: Plan to scale up to 50,000 users and beyond.
- **Microservice enhancements**: Introduce new microservices as the platform expands (e.g., analytics, recommendation engine).
- **Multi-region deployment**: Expand OpenShift clusters to multiple Azure regions for improved redundancy and reduced latency.
- **Global payment integration**: Explore support for additional payment gateways and currencies as the platform scales internationally.
