| Risk                                                                    | Mitigation                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Complexity of how the hosting of the microsites are going to work       | Talk with their developer and learn how they do it already|
| Complexity of Openshift                                                 | training of the developers and more research            |
| Non-functional requirements are vague (customer has no real usage data) | Make some assumptions together with customer and revisit|
