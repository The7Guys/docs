| Risk                                                                    | Mitigation                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Complexity of how the hosting of the microsites are going to work       | Talk with their developer and learn how they do it already|
| Complexity of Openshift                                                 | training of the developers and more research            |
| Non-functional requirements are vague (customer has no real usage data) | Make some assumptions together with customer and revisit|
| The development time is too short                                       | Prioritize the most important features and deliver them |
| There is a lot of potential simultaneous users                          | Load testing and scaling up the system                  |
| Team member is sick or unavailable                                      | Make sure that the team is cross-functional              |
| Services are not available                                              | Use a fallback mechanism or retry mechanism              |
| Services become too encumbered                                          | Spin up more instances                                  |
