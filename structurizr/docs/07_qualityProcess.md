## Quality process
- 2x meetings, 1 with client together with client and 1 with just the team to make sure we are up to date, and we are on the same page with the client and ask for feedback. 

- Both mobile and backend team will be working with one Trello board which will help us to know what everyone is doing and keeps us updated.  

- We will be reviewing each other's code to make sure that everyone is using the same coding standards and that there is not any breaking code pushed to the repository. 

- Team members will approve pull requests when the code is good, and the code can then be merged. 

- We will be consulting with the tech lead from the client side on issues we need help with that are related to the client ticketing system.
