## Application from a quality perspective
To be able to make sure that the application is robust, and that we are building a secure and functional app, these are some things we wish to implement:

### Validation (are we building the right system?)
- **Feedback on the requirements:** We're scheduling regular meetings with our client to gather feedback on our requirements. This will help us ensure the system we're building aligns with their needs.

- **User testing**: We'll involve end-users in testing our application to validate that it meets their expectations. This will give us valuable insights into user experience and help identify any issues they encounter.

- **Retrospectives/demos**: We're conducting regular demos and retrospectives to review the progress and get feedback from the team and client. We will then fix the processes that are not working well and improve the ones we already have with feedback.

- **Prototypes**: We're creating low-fidelity prototypes to get early feedback from users and also the client on the design and functionality of the application.


### Verification (are we building the system right?)
- **Unit tests**: We'll implement automated unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components or modules of the application. This will help us verify the functionality of individual modules and catch bugs early in the development process.

- **Integration testing**: We'll develop a comprehensive integration testing suite to ensure all components of our application work together seamlessly.

- **CDC (Consumer-Driven Contract) testing**: We'll verify the compatibility between the application and its dependencies by testing the contract between the consumer and provider.

- **End-to-end testing**: We'll create a set of end-to-end test scenarios that simulate real-world user interactions. These will validate the entire application flow and catch any issues that might not be apparent in isolated tests.

- **Static code analysis**: We'll analyze the codebase using static code analysis tools to identify and address potential issues, such as code quality, security vulnerabilities, and code consistency.


### Exploration (how can the system be abused/used in other ways?)
To prevent the application from being abused, we will consider the following measures:

- **Input validation**: We'll develop input validation mechanisms to sanitize and validate all user inputs. This will help prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.

- **Access controls**: We'll implement a comprehensive access control system that enforces the principle of least privilege. This includes role-based access controls and fine-grained permissions to limit unauthorized access and actions.

- **Security headers and policies**: We'll configuring appropriate security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) to mitigate common web application vulnerabilities.

- **Secure coding practices**: Our team is adhering to secure coding practices, including using parameterized queries for database interactions and implementing consistent input validation and output encoding.

- **Logging and monitoring**: We'll implement robust logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities, security incidents, and potential abuse attempts.

- **Implementing an API gateway**: We'll use an API gateway with rate limiting and load balancing, it will protect our backend services from being overwhelmed by too many requests. And Bb centralizing authentication and authorization, it reduces security vulnerabilities and blocks unauthorized requests
