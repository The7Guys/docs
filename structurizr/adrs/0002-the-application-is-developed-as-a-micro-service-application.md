# 2. The application is developed as a micro service application

Date: 2024-10-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Developing as a microservice application is one of the requirements for the application from school and it is also more scalable.


## Decision

The application is developed according to the micro-service architecture

## Consequences

We will be working with Openshift which comes with a lot of features and services out of the box. It will be easier to reuse services and to implement a scalabilty and reliability strategy. However, there has to be a lot of things set up to improve reliablity of the application for when things fail or stop working. Also, resources to run the application to make sure it is scalable and reliable are expensive.
