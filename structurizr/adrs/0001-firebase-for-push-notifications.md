# 1. Using firebase for Push Notification

Date: 2024-10-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When users add items to their wishlist, they will want to recieve push notifications for when the event is coming up.

## Decision
Firebase is free to use even at scale, which makes it perfect for startups and for small or large scale apps.

## Consequences
Migrating your data or services to another platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) can be complex due to Firebaseâ€™s proprietary architecture and APIs.
