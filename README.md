This architecture is not in any way complete or sane. It is to show you some way you could document your architecture.
NOT as an example how to do a good architecture.

## Application Architecture

An application **architecure as code** could look something like the layout from structurizr

Its got most of the categories in a seperate Markdown file with descriptions in text.
The structural decomposition is done in C4 https://c4model.com/  the model is in the file workspace.dsl
Architecture decisions in adr-tools https://docs.structurizr.com/dsl/adrs 

## Running structrurizer

I used structurizer lite per instructions on https://docs.structurizr.com/lite
using the docker/podman scheme
